# Household Cat's Activity Detection

The health, safety, and well-being of household pets such as cats has become a challenging
task in previous years. To estimate a cat’s behavior, objective observations of both the frequency
and variability of specific behavior traits are required, which might be difficult to come by in a cat’s
ordinary life. There is very little research on cat activity and cat disease analysis based on real-time
data. Although previous studies have made progress, several key questions still need addressing:
What types of data are best suited for accurately detecting activity patterns? Where should sensors be
strategically placed to ensure precise data collection, and how can the system be effectively automated
for seamless operation? This study addresses these questions by pointing out whether the cat should
be equipped with a sensor, and how the activity detection system can be automated. Magnetic, motion,
vision, audio, and location sensors are among the sensors used in the machine learning experiment.
In this study, we collect data using three types of differentiable and realistic wearable sensors, namely,
an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer. Therefore, this study aims to employ cat activity
detection techniques to combine data from acceleration, motion, and magnetic sensors, such as
accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, respectively, to recognize routine cat activity. Data
collecting, data processing, data fusion, and artificial intelligence approaches are all part of the system
established in this study. We focus on One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNNs)
in our research, to recognize cat activity modeling for detection and classification. Such 1D-CNNs
have recently emerged as a cutting-edge approach for signal processing-based systems such as
sensor-based pet and human health monitoring systems, anomaly identification in manufacturing,
and in other areas. Our study culminates in the development of an automated system for robust pet
(cat) activity analysis using artificial intelligence techniques, featuring a 1D-CNN-based approach.
In this experimental research, the 1D-CNN approach is evaluated using training and validation
sets. The approach achieved a satisfactory accuracy while detecting the activity useful for
cat well-being.
